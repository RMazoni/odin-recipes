This is my first practical project The Odin Project

The goal with this project is to practice my HTML skills, but also
getting used to make consistent git commits as I build the project.

The project itself will be a basic recipe website, having
a main index page that will link to a few recipes pages.

At first, it will be pure HTML, but as I move forward with TOP path
I will improve it with new knowledge, like CSS.
