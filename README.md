This is my first practical project from The Odin Project path

The goal with this project is to practice my HTML skills, but also
getting used to making consistent git commits as I build the project.

The project itself will be a basic recipe website, having a main
index page that will link to a few recipes pages.

At first, it will be pure HTML, but as I move forward with TOP path
I will improve it with new knowledge, like CSS.
